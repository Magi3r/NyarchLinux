# Contributing

We are happy to hear that you are interested in contributing to Nyarch Linux. 

## Reporting bugs
If you encounter a bug in Nyarch Linux, please open an issue describing it. Note that Nyarch Linux is not 
really supposed to be daily-driven (at least for the moment), some conrner-case bugs may be just ignored, or be fixed
in a long span of time.

## Art, wallpapers etc
If you are an artist, contributions are welcomed, specially for editing logos or new wallpapers. <br />
Be sure to not use copyrighted art, and add any artist who contributed to CREDITS.md of the distro spin.
If your art is here and you don't want to, or if there are no credits to your work, please open an issue and we will take action.

## Adding new features
### Our guidelines
<b>Before making a suggestion or a pull request, check that it follows at least a good part of these guidelines</b>
- The ISO should not overcome 3.6GB of size, so avoid suggesting features that highly increase its size
- (not required) Applications must look coherent in the desktop spin, and coherent to its theme if possible.
- (not strictly required) If a desktop uses a certain toolkit for its applications, the main pre-installed applications must use that toolkit if possible.
For example, while the Gnome spin provides Komikku (GTK applications to read manga), KDE spin should provide a QT equivalent if there is. 
- Excluding drivers, all applications must be open source. (for example, you can't pre-install Discord)
- Browser extensions should not included by default, but they can be suggested in Nyarch Tour or similar welcome screens.
- All the code in our repositories must be GPLv3 compatible
- Do not include copyrighted art in the source code. If you use some art you didn't make, be sure to mention the artist in CREDITS.md of the spin.
